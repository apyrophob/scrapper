  "comment": "Well played to the team at Spotify for convincing me to restart my Audible subscription. Audiobooks seemed like a great idea until I discovered you want Â£9.99 for an additional 10hrs listening time!!! Why would I use this when I can subscribe to Audible for Â£7.99 a month, get unlimited listening time, and get a superior user interface and seemless experience with my Kindle. Serious own goal from the commercial team over there at Spotify Towers. ðŸ˜‚",
