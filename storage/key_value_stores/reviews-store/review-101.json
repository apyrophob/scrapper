  "comment": "the app got worse because of the litreal useless update to enhance their premium offerings, spotify I don't see people getting attracted to the update u put up, nor it's gonna give u more premium account users, instead it would just degrade ur downloaders, people have started to delete this app, and this is one of the biggest losses for u, count me in too. Uninstalled.",
