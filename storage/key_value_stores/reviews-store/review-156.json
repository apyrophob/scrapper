  "comment": "App doesn't load properly since the last update. It states no internet connection even when I'm connected to a wifi network. When it finally loads after minutes it's sluggish and I can't change my audio setting ls. It says data saver is on which clearly isn't. Please get this sorted as I can't use the app the way I'm used to.",
